# Loan-Repayment-Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a borrower will repay their loan on time using AI and machine learning. By analyzing data like income, loan amount, and credit history, we build a model that helps financial institutions assess the risk of lending. The model is deployed in a user-friendly web application, providing instant predictions and enabling smarter, data-driven lending decisions.
